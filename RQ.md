# Research Questions:

### What vulnerabilities occur in supervised learning-based projects? 
### How frequently do vulnerabilities occur in supervised learning-based projects? (No tool)
### Vulnerability trend in supervised learning-based projects by severity.
### What is the lifetime of the identified vulnerability occurrences for supervised learning-based projects? (Survival analysis for ML) 


#### Vulnerability Distribution. How are vulnerabilities distributed? Can it be used for hunting new vulnerabilities?
#### Vulnerability Dependency. Why are vulnerabilities often times found within a short code range? Is there any dependency between vulnerabilities?
#### Vulnerability Recurrence. Why do vulnerabilities repeatedly occur in the same function? Is it a general case?
